## Community Domain Research Foundation

This LLM-powered polling app prototype is built upon comprehensive research data analyzing community priorities across different geographic and demographic contexts in the United States.

### üìç Data Source
**Research Location**: Comprehensive community priority analysis  
**Data Access**: [Claude Research Session](https://claude.ai/share/e5976a97-8f11-49aa-92c7-b6c7b22e5c9b)  
**Time Period**: 2024 to 2025  
**Geographic Scope**: Multiple sources across the United States  

### üèòÔ∏è Community Type Classifications

Our polling app prototype uses research-informed domain categories for four distinct community types:

#### Urban Community Priorities
1. Crime and Public Safety
2. Housing Affordability  
3. Economic Development
4. Infrastructure & City Services
5. Transportation

#### Suburban Town Priorities  
1. Traffic Congestion & School Safety
2. Infrastructure Maintenance
3. School Quality & Segregation
4. Property Taxes
5. Environmental Concerns

#### Rural Area Priorities
1. Digital Infrastructure Gap
2. Healthcare Access
3. Economic Opportunities
4. Aging Population Services
5. Infrastructure Decay

#### University Town Priorities
1. Student Housing Shortage
2. Town-Gown Relations
3. Parking and Transportation
4. Noise and Disruption
5. Economic Dependence on University

### üî¨ Research Methodology

The domain categories were derived from:
- Multi-geographic data collection across US communities
- Analysis of community priority patterns by demographic type
- Identification of recurring themes and challenges
- Validation across different regional contexts

### üéØ Application Implementation

**Domain Selection Logic**:
- Users select their community type
- System presents research-based domain options
- Generated polling topics align with documented community priorities
- Eliminates guesswork and ensures relevance

**Quality Assurance**:
- All domain categories backed by research findings
- Regular validation against emerging community trends
- Continuous refinement based on user feedback and new data

### üìö Attribution

This polling app prototype acknowledges and builds upon comprehensive community research conducted in 2024-2025. The research findings inform our domain categorization and ensure that generated polling topics reflect real-world community priorities and challenges.
